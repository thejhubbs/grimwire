                  <h5>Teachings</h5><p>things that are explicity from a Teacher or Philosopher to a group/another, ex. Buddha, Plato </p>
                  <h5>Concept</h5><p>a thing/idea/word that many people have talked about, ex. Enlightenment, God </p>
                  <h5>Story</h5><p>A fable or myth that was used & understood to be a metaphor of how the world worked, ex. Greek Myths </p>
                  <h5>Scripture</h5><p>text that has several layers, not completely just a Teaching, and not simply a Story, and usualy claimed as Divine, ex. Old Testament & Vedic Texts.</p>
                  <h5>Source</h5><p>Any book or media that provides information.</p>
                  <p><b>There can be several entries regarding the "same" item.</b></p>
                  <p>Example, "New Testament" is the name of the "Source" article, and has information about the historical findings of the actual texts.</p>
                  <p>"The Testament of Matthew", and John, etc. can be "Scripture" articles, and have information about what those say and how they differ, their plots, and interpretations.</p>
                  <p>Certain speeches that Jesus was quoted as giving, i.e. "The Sermon on The Mount" can have it's own "Teaching" page.</p>
                  <p>Similarly, "Jesus" can be the "Person" page, featuring information about the person, while "Christ", "Baptism", and "Holy Spirit" have a "Concept" page.</p>
                  <p>The power of this App is how it all links everything together, each page is linked to the necessary ones.</p>
